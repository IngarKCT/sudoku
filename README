SUDOKU SOLVER
	
	I'm not a fervent sudoku solver but I always wanted to try implementing
	a program to solve the puzzles faster than I can. This is my first attempt.
	
	This program uses the Qt library for its user interface, you will need
	to have it installed to run the program.
	
BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS

	Basic building instructions

		mkdir build
		cd build
		../configure
		make
		
	The binary will be called 'sudokusolver' and be located in the 'src' directory.

USAGE

	Running the program will show the main window, which consists of a basic
	sudoku grid (9x9) and a number of buttons.

	The SAVE button allows you to save the current sudoku puzzle to a file,
	like wise, the LOAD button allwos you to load a previously saved sudoko.

	The file format is extremely simple: the files can be opened and edited
	with a text editor. Note that empty (unsolved) positions are saved as well.

	The CLEAR button will clear any previously entered numbers.

	The STEP button can be used to solve the puzzle. If clicked, the program
	will verify each empty cell. If a unique solution can be found for a cell,
	it will be added to the solution. You will probably need to click STEP
	several times to completely solve a puzzle.

LIMITATIONS

	The current solving algorithm will only find a complete solution as long
	as there are cells for which a unique solution through elimination can be found.
	It cannot perform an exhautive search if the sudoko contains only cells for 
	which at least 2 solutions can be found.
