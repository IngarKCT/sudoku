SUDOKU SOLVER
	
	I'm not a fervent sudoku solver but I always wanted to try implementing
	a program to solve the puzzles faster than I can. This is my first attempt.
	
	This program uses the Qt library for its user interface, you will need
	to have it installed to run the program.
	
BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS

	Basic building instructions

		mkdir build
		cd build
		../configure
		make
		
	The binary will be called 'sudokusolver' and be located in the 'src' directory.
